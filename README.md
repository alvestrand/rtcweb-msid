rtcweb-msid
===========
This is the XML source for draft-ietf-mmusic-msid (which is a work item of
MMUSIC, but is mostly used in an RTCWEB context, thus the naming confusion).

Use "make rtcweb-msid.txt" (or just "make") to generate the text version.

You need a "references" subdirectory; this can conveniently be a symlink to
a shared repository, since it's large, and takes a long time to update.
